# AutoLyrics

### By JDipi

### [CLI version made with Python!](https://github.com/JDipi/AutoLyrics-python)

> Do you have a bunch of mp3 files you want to add lyrics to, but don't want to copy paste lyrics from Genius.com? Well this Electron app is perfect for you!

This is my first Electron app, which I wrote as an improvement of [my python version](https://github.com/JDipi/AutoLyrics-python). It works by scraping Genius.com or Azlyrics.com (i'll probably add other sources) and writing the lyrics to any selected file.

Theres a bunch of stuff I still need to fix I just wanted to start learning Git by pushing my code to this repo

Will fix soon:
- Either get rid of or add some actions to the file/menu bar
- Allow a way for the user to write or change common tags other than lyrics (title, artist, album, album cover)
- Clean up some css and figure out something to fill up the empty space in the lower middle
- Figure out how to make a "release" on GitHub
- Make a logo for the title bar
- Get all of the title bar actions to work
- Weird bug where the tooltips are cloned and stacked on each other
- Stop using so many "any" type definitions ðŸ˜…
